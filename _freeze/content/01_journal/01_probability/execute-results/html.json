The following probabilities have been determined using historical project data:\n\nAssume P(T) as probability of project being done on time and P(S) as probability of change of scope of project.\n\n-   Probability of a change in scope, $$\n    P(S) = 0.3 \\\\\n    P(\\bar S) =  0.7\n    $$\n-   Probability of completing/not completing the project on time, given the change in scope, $$\n      P(T \\mid S) = 0.2 \\\\\n      P(\\bar T \\mid S) = 0.8 \\\\\n      P(T \\mid \\bar S) = 0.6 \\\\\n      P(\\bar T \\mid \\bar S) = 0.4 \\\\\n    $$\n\n## Objective\n\nCompute the following probabilities and the sum of all four probabilities: $$\nP(T \\cap S) \\\\\nP(\\bar T \\cap S) \\\\\nP(T \\cap \\bar S) \\\\\nP(\\bar T \\cap \\bar S) \\\\\n$$\n\n## Solution\n\n### Code\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='01_probability_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_dc614c20dd4bef1b70a8edd05fa1400b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Assign probabilities of events T and S\nprob_S <- 0.3\nprob_S_T <- 0.2\nprob_S_Tbar <- 0.8\n\nprob_Sbar <- 0.7\nprob_Sbar_T <- 0.6\nprob_Sbar_Tbar <- 0.4\n\n# Calculate P(T ∩ S)\nprob_T_and_S <- prob_S_T * prob_S\n\n# Calculate P(T ∩ S_bar)\nprob_T_and_S_bar <- prob_Sbar_T * prob_Sbar\n\n# Calculate P(T_bar ∩ S)\nprob_not_T_and_S <- prob_S_Tbar * prob_S\n\n# Calculate P(T_bar ∩ S_bar)\nprob_not_T_and_not_S <- prob_Sbar_Tbar * prob_Sbar\n\n# Sum of all probalilities\nsum <- prob_T_and_S + prob_T_and_S_bar + prob_not_T_and_S + prob_not_T_and_not_S\n\n# Print the results\nprob_T_and_S\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 0.06\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprob_T_and_S_bar\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 0.42\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprob_not_T_and_S\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 0.24\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprob_not_T_and_not_S\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 0.28\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe provided R code calculates the probabilities of different events based on the given probabilities for a project being delivered on time, considering the occurrence of a change in scope. The results are printed, including the probabilities of the project being delivered on time with and without a change in scope, and the sum of all four probabilities.\n\n# Probability Theory - Assignment II\n\n![](/assets/img/chap1-assign2_01.png){#assign02_vennDiag fig-align=\"center\" width=\"80%\"}\n\nUsing the above Venn Diagram, we are to answer the following questions:\n\n-   What is the percentage of customers using all three devices?\n\n    <u>**Solution**</u>: This is the region where all three circles in the diagram intersect - <u>*0.5%*</u>\n\n-   What is the percentage of customers using at least two devices?\n\n    <u>**Solution**</u>: This will be the sum of percentages in the region of intersection of two or more circles - <u>*19.9%*</u>\n\n-   What is the percentage of customers using only one device?\n\n    <u>**Solution**</u>: This will be the sum of percentages of which are exclusive of each other - <u>*80.01%*</u>\n",
