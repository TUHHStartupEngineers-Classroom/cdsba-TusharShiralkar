# Probability Theory - Assignment I

Imagine you are a project manager assessing the probability of a project being delivered on time based on the occurrence of a change in scope. The following probabilities have been determined using historical project data:

Assume P(T) as probability of project being done on time and P(S) as probability of change of scope of project.

-   Probability of a change in scope, $$
    P(S) = 0.3 \\
    P(\bar S) =  0.7
    $$
-   Probability of completing/not completing the project on time, given the change in scope, $$
      P(T \mid S) = 0.2 \\
      P(\bar T \mid S) = 0.8 \\
      P(T \mid \bar S) = 0.6 \\
      P(\bar T \mid \bar S) = 0.4 \\
    $$

## Objective

Compute the following probabilities and the sum of all four probabilities: $$
P(T \cap S) \\
P(\bar T \cap S) \\
P(T \cap \bar S) \\
P(\bar T \cap \bar S) \\
$$

## Solution

### Code

```{r}

# Assign probabilities of events T and S
prob_S <- 0.3
prob_S_T <- 0.2
prob_S_Tbar <- 0.8

prob_Sbar <- 0.7
prob_Sbar_T <- 0.6
prob_Sbar_Tbar <- 0.4

# Calculate P(T ∩ S)
prob_T_and_S <- prob_S_T * prob_S

# Calculate P(T ∩ S_bar)
prob_T_and_S_bar <- prob_Sbar_T * prob_Sbar

# Calculate P(T_bar ∩ S)
prob_not_T_and_S <- prob_S_Tbar * prob_S

# Calculate P(T_bar ∩ S_bar)
prob_not_T_and_not_S <- prob_Sbar_Tbar * prob_Sbar

# Sum of all probalilities
sum <- prob_T_and_S + prob_T_and_S_bar + prob_not_T_and_S + prob_not_T_and_not_S

# Print the results
prob_T_and_S
prob_T_and_S_bar
prob_not_T_and_S
prob_not_T_and_not_S
sum
```

The provided R code calculates the probabilities of different events based on the given probabilities for a project being delivered on time, considering the occurrence of a change in scope. The results are printed, including the probabilities of the project being delivered on time with and without a change in scope, and the sum of all four probabilities.

Using the above Venn Diagram, we are to answer the following questions:

-   What is the percentage of customers using all three devices?

    <u>**Solution**</u>: This is the region where all three circles in the diagram intersect - <u>*0.5%*</u>

-   What is the percentage of customers using at least two devices?

    <u>**Solution**</u>: This will be the sum of percentages in the region of intersection of two or more circles - <u>*19.9%*</u>

-   What is the percentage of customers using only one device?

    <u>**Solution**</u>: This will be the sum of percentages of which are exclusive of each other - <u>*80.01%*</u>
